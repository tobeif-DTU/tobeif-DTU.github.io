We just finished a wonderful example of configuration design, i.e., that rethinking different configurations is key for actually achieving a good product. 

In collaboration with DEcathlon in France, our student worked with rethinking car rooftop tents. Very nice product and fantastic educational example to ask the question what we actually achieve with simple optimisation. How we make sure that we derive good configurations for our products

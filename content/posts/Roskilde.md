**Going to wonderful Roskilde this week?** In this case, make sure to visit our Twinfinder group, just one example from our Design of Mechatronics class contributing to the [Roskilde Festival - powered by DTU Students](https://roskilde.dtu.dk/) initiative. 

**In brief,** the group has built an automatic Twin Finder system to spark spontaneous encounters, and perhaps ask some deeper questions regarding social networks, biases in AI, etc.  Perhaps :smiley:)! But definitely great fun!

Last week, our student Penelope successfully defended her MSc thesis presenting a wonderful example of a configuration design task, i.e., the task of rethinking/exploring the space of mechanical configurations based on design trade-off knowledge.

**Project:** In close collaboration with [Decathlon](https://www.decathlon.com), Penelope applied this idea of configuration design on car rooftop tents providing valuable input to the design team and sparking new project ideas for potential future solutions. A very cool product and a fantastic case example to ask the question what we can actually achieve based o a systematic understanding of active constraints and trade-offs between the various design objectives (instead of simple design heuristics / best-practices).

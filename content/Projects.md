#  Current projects
We usually have some projects "on stock", which you find below. You will find that many of the suggested projects closely relate to either ongoing research projects or also our interest in a variety of new research areas. 

Therefore, please also check out the [Research]({{< relref path=Research.md >}}) section in case that you're having an idea for a MSc/BSc thesis topic. Projects that address/relate to one of our current research directions will usually be prioritized (partly due to time and resource constraints, but also to ensure suitable supervision). 

If you're interested in our supervision procedures, please have a look [here]({{< relref path=Supervision.md >}})

##  Project Scoping
We usually have some projects "on stock", which you find below. You will find that many of the suggested projects closely relate to either ongoing research projects or also our interest in a variety of new research areas. 

Therefore, please also check out the [Research]({{< relref path=Research.md >}}) section in case that you're having an idea for a MSc/BSc thesis topic. Projects that address/relate to one of our current research directions will usually be prioritized (partly due to time and resource constraints, but also to ensure suitable supervision). 

And for an overview for our project scoping/supervision process please check [here]({{< relref path=Supervision.md >}}) 

## Currently available projects
as I didn't have much time for preparation of the fall semester, there quite some topics "on stock", where a student (team) can have a really nice impact. Most topics are also suitable in a special course format, preferably as kick-off to some larger project afterwards though. 

### Robust Design projects
While not necessarily our main focus, we still run typical RD projects, i.e., projects focusing on kinematics regularly.  have expressed interest so that  
* **Robust & Tolerance Design of Audio Equipment**
  in collaboration with [Sowa](https://www.sowasound.com/), a Brand that started at DTU and delivers advanced wireless technology solutions.
* **More company projects for FA2026 in the pipeline**

### Simulation & Optimisation
* **Robust Design Optimisation of plastic structures**
  in collaboration with [Perma Pedal](https://permapadel.com/) a startup a DTU that rethinks the design and manufacturing of Pedal rackets.
* **CFD-based scaling of pharmaceutical production processes**
  as part of our collaboration with [PROSYS](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/research/prosys)

### AI-based enrichment of Design Data
for example in the field of 3D classification / LLM / Graph representation learning/ Graph Representation Learning.

### Innovation Projects
* **Next Generation Climbing holds** 
  for the climbing enthusiast who'd like to be part of an innovation story, looking into a new concept of climbing holds based on the detailed analysis and optimisation of polymer microstructures.

### Remanufactory projects
We're part of the new DTU project on Remanufacturing, see also  [Remanufactory](https://www.dtu.dk/english/news/all-news/new-national-centre-to-fill-crucial-gap-in-denmarks-remanufacturing-efforts?id=1399b494-c350-43eb-84f4-adfac314d997) or also our [Research]({{< relref path=Research.md >}}). In this context we currently have a number of directions we'd could use some motivated hands to impact DTU-research in the right direction :-)
* **Design & Construction of Disassembly Stations**
  Help us building up of physical setup here at DTU, and develop a suitable reconfigurable disassembly set-up for the remanufactury.
* **(Dis)assemble them all**
  There has been really interesting research on assembly algorithms (e.g., https://assembly.csail.mit.edu/), which we would like to transfer to the field of Disassembly procedures.
* **Remanufacturing assessment & Reassembly Simulation**

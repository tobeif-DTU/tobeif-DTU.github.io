##  Project Scoping
We usually have some projects "on stock", which you find below. You will find that many of the suggested projects closely relate to either ongoing research projects or also our interest in a variety of new research areas. 

Therefore, please also check out the [Research]({{< relref path=Research.md >}}) section in case that you're having an idea for a MSc/BSc thesis topic of your own. Projects that address/relate to one of our current research directions will usually be prioritized (to ensure suitable supervision and due time/resource constraints). 

And for an overview for our project scoping/supervision process please check [here]({{< relref path=Supervision.md >}}) (*currently a copy from a dear colleague / but fits quite well*)

## Currently available projects
as I didn't have much time in the last month for preparing the fall semester, we've quite some directions where a student team can have a really nice impact. Most topics are also suitable in a special course format, usually run as kick-off for some larger project afterwards though! 

### Robust Design projects
While not necessarily our main focus in research, we still run typical RD projects regularly, i.e., projects with the main focus on kinematics & tolerances. Current examples:  
* **Robust & Tolerance Design of Audio Equipment**
  in collaboration with [Sowa](https://www.sowasound.com/), a Brand that started at DTU and delivers advanced wireless technology solutions.
* **More company projects for FA2026 in the pipeline**

### Simulation & Optimisation
Some of the current examples including Simulation, DoE & sampling, and surrogate modelling: 
* **Robust Design Optimisation of plastic structures**
  in collaboration with [Perma Pedal](https://permapadel.com/) a startup a DTU that rethinks the design and manufacturing of Pedal rackets.
* **CFD-based scaling of pharmaceutical production processes**
  identification of relevant/sensitive parameters on different scales (lab, pre-series, large batch) and definition of scaling relationships (based on our collaboration with [PROSYS](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/research/prosys))

### AI-based enrichment of Design Data
If you're interested in playing around with image or 3D classification, LLMs, graphs, etc.:
* **Vision Systems for real time tolerance monitoring** 
  either as part of Digital Twins or also in 100% inspection for circularity (see below)
* interesting might also be **[Artificial Intelligence for (Material) Design & Discovery](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/47341)** 
  project within the course were you'll be supervised by us and a colleague from the AI/ML field

### Innovation Projects
* **Next Generation Climbing holds** 
  if you're a climbing enthusiast who'd like to be part of an innovation story looking into a new concept of climbing holds based on the detailed analysis and optimisation of polymer microstructures **[Project description](href="/files/Sisu.pdf")**.

### Remanufactory projects
We're part of DTU's new national center for Remanufacturing funded by [Industriensfond](https://industriensfond.dk/), see also  [Remanufactory](https://www.dtu.dk/english/news/all-news/new-national-centre-to-fill-crucial-gap-in-denmarks-remanufacturing-efforts?id=1399b494-c350-43eb-84f4-adfac314d997). In this context we can definitely use help from motivated students pushing DTU-research in the right direction :smiley: !
* **Design & Construction of Disassembly Stations**
  Help us building up of physical setup here at DTU
* **Remanufacturing assessment & Reassembly Simulation**
  Analysis Disassemblability & Remanufacturability, incl. role of tolerances and lifecycle robustness 
* **(Dis)assemble them all**
  implementation of really interesting research on (dis)assembly algorithms (e.g., https://assembly.csail.mit.edu/).

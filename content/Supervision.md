##  Current projects
We usually have some projects "on stock", which you find below. You will find that many of the suggested projects closely relate to either ongoing research projects or also our interest in a variety of new research areas. 

Therefore, please also check out the [Research]({{< relref path=Research.md >}}) section in case that you're having an idea for a MSc/BSc thesis topic. Projects that address/relate to one of our current research directions will usually be prioritized (partly due to time and resource constraints, but also to ensure suitable supervision). 


####  Robust & Tolerance Design of Audio Equipment
in collaboration with [Sowa](https://www.sowasound.com/), a Brand that started at DTU and delivers advanced wireless technology solutions in timeless Danish design.

## Preparing for a Thesis

It’s fine to come and ask for a thesis subject. I usually have several research ideas “on stock” that are be suitable for a thesis topic. You may also have an idea yourself, but as mentioned above, I would need to give preference to topics that are releated to our ongoing research.

Whether you want to discuss your own idea, or we have discussed a topic suitable for your thesis, the next step is preparing a short description of this idea. It is important that you, as a student, write this text, to reduce the risk of mis-communication.

You should then consider the following points, and sum it up on one A4 page, using the following template and mailing it to me in advance:

1. A **thesis title** (in English and in Danish) that sums up what you will be doing.
    
2. **The problem** the thesis is addressing, preferably with reference to state of the art and/or research topics that you have looked into. This could be many things…
    
3. **The methods** planned to be used addressing the problem.
    
4. **The planned outcome**.
    

In additon, you need to include also important details like:

5. Your study number sNNNNNN,
    
6. The type of project (MSc, BSc or BEng),
    
7. The expected starting (and ending) dates and
    
8. How many points (30, 32.5 or 35 for a MSc, 15 or 20 usually for a BSc project).
    

It usually takes a couple of iterations to get nailed down. But once it’s agreed, this will then form the basis for registering the project.

Note that this should be done latest 2 weeks in advance to the project date – but in many cases it is preferable to do this much earlier (even up to half a year in advance), since it will allow a better preparation and possibly also to select final courses that are relevant for the thesis.

A thesis can be done when miss 15 or less ECTS in regular course-work.

It can be done individually or with a small group. I usually don’t recommend more than two persons that trust and know one another well.

Also, you should have a look at the overall learning objectives of a master thesis and requirements, to be sure this is addressed with your thesis – here quoting from the [Study Handbook](https://studieinformation.dtu.dk/) [(Direct link for H-CAI)](https://studieinformation.dtu.dk/english/master-of-science-in-engineering/human-centered-artificial-intelligence/programme-specification#Master's_thesis). This is from the 2023 edition; check for any updates:

> **The content and learning objectives of the thesis**
> 
> The content of the thesis is to be agreed upon with a supervisor. Find more information on the supervisor below in the section ‘’The supervisor’.
> 
> The thesis may contain a combination of experimental work, fieldwork, theoretical studies, synthesis, modelling, and analysis. All theses must include elements of literature studies and criticism. In addition, the thesis contains the following overarching learning objectives:
> 
> A graduate of the MSc programme from DTU:
> 
> - can identify and reflect on technical scientific issues and understand the interaction between the various components that make up an issue
>     
> - can, based on a clear academic profile, apply elements of current research at an international level to develop ideas and solve problems
>     
> - masters technical scientific methodologies, theories, and tools, and can take a holistic view of and delimit a complex, open issue, put it into a broader academic and societal perspective, and, on this basis, propose a variety of possible actions while considering sustainability
>     
> - can develop relevant models, systems, technologies, and processes aimed at solving technological problems
>     
> - can communicate and mediate research-based knowledge both orally and in writing
>     
> - is familiar with and can seek out leading international research within their specialist area.
>     
> - can work independently and reflect on own learning, academic development, and specialization
>     
> - masters technical problem-solving at a high level through cross-disciplinary teamwork, and can work with and manage all phases of a project – including preparation of timetables, design, solution, and documentation
>     

In particular, it’s important to ensure the thesis contains both empirical elements (i.e. something you do “in the field” or synthesising solutions etc) and scientific/academical elements (based on litterature etc).

## Supervision process

Typically, we meet every 2 weeks in a commom meeting with all project students. All other required supervision will be organised according to your needs (usually the supervision slots are Tuesday & Wednesday given other teaching duties).

In the supervision meetings, we typically talk about

1. What was achieved (sometimes compared to what was planned) since our last meeting,
2. Any current problems that needs to be addressed,
3. What are the key topics to address for the next 1-2 weeks (your “sprint”), and
4. What could possibly go wrong…

It is a good idea if you prepare by bringing and presenting your “results”, whether it is a machine learning model, a set of results and statistical tests, qualitative feedback from your interviews, a concrete UI you have designed, some running piece of code or your 3D printed prototype, a table overview of the literature you have reviewed, existing solutions or something else.

## Research in Advanced Engineering Design
The objective of my research is to widen the applicability of detailed engineering and optimization knowledge in earlier design stages to allow for better informed (design) decision making when conceptualizing and developing robust physical assemblies. This includes three main thrusts, all related to the questions of variation in engineering and development. While our background is the fundamental idea of Robust Design, Kinematic design heuristics, and tolerancing knowledge, we have gradually developed this direction towards a comprehensive toolbox for design automation and design exploration. Lastly, variation is only increasing when looking into circular products and the question of several lifecycles.

Fundamental to our work is the exploration of new product configurations based on the developed theory of design trade-offs, i.e., contradicting requirements or constraints that drastically limit the attainable design space and often result in a reduced window for allowable variation. This idea interfaces well with approaches in the field of material design for energy systems, development of pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment, and digital twin approaches (areas that are explored in an interdisciplinary approach at DTU / see also list of research collaborations below). 

My ambition is to keep this research industrially relevant throughout continuous industrial collaboration and to systematically incorporate it into undergraduate and post graduate education, in order to enable students, PhDs, and design practitioners to solve the todayâ€™s challenges and to shape engineering design practices for the future.

## Current Research Projects
Overview of current research projects following shortly

## Interdisciplinary Research

#### with DTU Compute ([Statistics and Data Analysis](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/sections/stat))
Working on the consideration of computational experimentation (e.g., DoEs, adaptive sampling strategies, surrogate modelling based on FEA/CFD), data-driven analysis of batch processes (dynamic PCA), and digital twin solutions (Model validation & verification). 

#### with DTU Chemistry ([PROSYS](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/research/prosys))
Working on scaling of pharmaceutical mixing processes, e.g., in form of powder characterisation questions or also computational experimentation with CFD Simulations. 

#### with [DTU Energy](https://www.energy.dtu.dk/)
Working on Systematic procedures for exploring the configuration space across different levels of detail (micro, meso, macro scale) based on traditional computational experimentation strategies or AI/ML (graph-based learning strategies). 

## Got interested in our publications
We try to keep as much open access as we possibly can. You can check the available downloads (and all other papers) on [DTU Orbit](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/tobias-eifler/publications/)

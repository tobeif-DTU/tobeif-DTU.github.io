      <title>A fantastic Re-Use application</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainability is not only about preserving the future. It’s about reimagining the present, where yesterday’s devices become tomorrow’s opportunities.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation often begins not with something new, but with a new way of thinking about the old, re-imagining its role in shaping the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while avoiding new waste recirculating old products is key, corresponding thoughts might be quite inspirational for actually rethinking how we treat electronic waste in our society. In this context the university of Tartu has repurposed old phones to build small data centers, outperfoming more (&lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/smartphone-data-centers&#34;&gt;Link here&lt;/a&gt;))&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Configuration Design</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We just finished a wonderful example of configuration design, i.e., that rethinking different configurations is key for actually achieving a good product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with DEcathlon in France, our student worked with rethinking car rooftop tents. Very nice product and fantastic educational example to ask the question what we actually achieve with simple optimisation. How we make sure that we derive good configurations for our products&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparing-for-a-thesis&#34;&gt;Preparing for a Thesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s fine to come and ask for a thesis subject. I usually have several research ideas “on stock” that are be suitable for a thesis topic. You may also have an idea yourself, but as mentioned above, I would need to give preference to topics that are related to our ongoing research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you want to discuss your own idea, or we have discussed a topic suitable for your thesis, the next step is preparing a short description of this idea. It is important that you, as a student, write this text, to reduce the risk of mis-communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-in-advanced-engineering-design&#34;&gt;Research in Advanced Engineering Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of my research is to widen the applicability of detailed engineering and optimization knowledge in earlier design stages to allow for better informed (design) decision making when conceptualizing and developing robust physical assemblies. Fundamental to this work is the exploration of new product configurations based on the developed theory of design trade-offs, i.e., contradicting requirements or constraints that drastically limit the attainable design space and often result in a reduced window for allowable variation. This idea interfaces well with approaches in the field of material design for energy systems, development of pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment, and digital twin approaches (areas that are explored in an interdisciplinary approach at DTU / see also list of research collaborations). Lastly, my ambition is to keep this research industrially relevant throughout continuous industrial collaboration and to systematically incorporate it into undergraduate and post graduate education, in order to enable students, PhDs, and design practitioners to solve the today’s challenges and to shape engineering design practices for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;current-projects&#34;&gt;Current projects&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We usually have some projects &amp;ldquo;on stock&amp;rdquo;, which you find below. You will find that many of the suggested projects closely relate to either ongoing research projects or also our interest in a variety of new research areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, please also check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/research/&#34;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; section in case that you&amp;rsquo;re having an idea for a MSc/BSc thesis topic. Projects that address/relate to one of our current research directions will usually be prioritized (partly due to time and resource constraints, but also to ensure suitable supervision).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
